# Prep exercise - traffic light

This repository contains four JavaScript files that simulate the operation of a traffic light. The primary goal was to practice logic and loops.

---

### Files

- **`traffic-light-1.js`** and **`traffic-light-2.js`**: These files demonstrate different approaches to simulating a traffic light using `while` loops.

- **`traffic-light-3-for.js`** and **`traffic-light-4-switch.js`**: These files further explore the use of `for` loops and `switch` statements to manage the traffic light simulation.

### Requirements

The main objective was to create a functioning traffic light simulation that:

- Displays the traffic light's status
- Completes 2 full cycles of operation
- Turns off after completing the cycles

I also created a webpage with a traffic light simulator on CodePen. You can interact with the simulator by turning the lights on and off. Check it out here: [Traffic Light Simulation](https://codepen.io/liya_oz/pen/LYKoRRj)

Feel free to review the files and provide feedback on the implementation.
