# Prep Exercise

This repository contains folders with weekly preparation exercises. The primary goal was to practice JavaScript logic, loops, and scope structures.

## Week 1

Week 1 contains four JavaScript files that simulate the operation of a traffic light.

### Files

- **`traffic-light-1.js`** and **`traffic-light-2.js`**: These files demonstrate different approaches to simulating a traffic light using `while` loops.
- **`traffic-light-3-for.js`** and **`traffic-light-4-switch.js`**: These files further explore the use of `for` loops and `switch` statements to manage the traffic light simulation.

### Requirements

The main objective was to create a functioning traffic light simulation that:
- Displays the traffic light's status
- Completes 2 full cycles of operation
- Turns off after completing the cycles

Additionally, I created a webpage with a traffic light simulator on CodePen. You can interact with the simulator by turning the lights on and off. Check it out here: [Traffic Light Simulation](https://codepen.io/liya_oz/pen/LYKoRRj).

## Week 2

Week 2 contains two JavaScript files:

- **`traffic-light.js`**: This file simulates a traffic light in a different way from the Week 1 examples.
- **`index.js`**: This file uses the `Math.random()` function to simulate rolling a die. The goal is to test how well `Math.random()` distributes values evenly across the range of 0 to 1 over many iterations. We will perform this simulation for increasing sample sizes and expect the results to approach 16.6% for each value (1 through 6).


Feel free to review the files and provide feedback on the implementation.
